In the octave of the sonnet, Milton (a religious man) questions how someone without vision can best serve God. This theme is most clearly expressed in line seven, towards the end of the octave:\\n\"Doth God exact day-labour, light denied?\"\\n\\n\\nNotice how Milton wraps up his theme with an explicit question, asking whether work (“day labor”) is demanded (“exact”ed) by the heavens from those who are blind (with “light denied”).

Consider how the following phrases set the mood of the sonnet:\\n\\n“this dark world and wide”\\n\"one Talent which is death to hide\"\\n“Lodged with me useless\"\\nEach of these phrases helps create the sonnet’s mood.

For example, the word “several” has three syllables, but adding an apostrophe to turn “several” into “sev’ral” takes off a syllable. Milton uses this technique in line thirteen of \"On His Blindness,\" turning the two-syllable “over” into the one-syllable “o’er”:\\n“And post o’er land and ocean without rest;\"\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can swap around the elements of sentences in your sonnet to fit your rhyme scheme or to maintain iambic pentameter. For example, instead of writing “She drove her car,” you can write “Her car she drove.” Don\\'t be afraid to sound old-fashioned in a sonnet! Milton freely switches around sentence structure in “On His Blindness,” including in line fourteen. In this line, Milton could have flatly written that “Those who only stand and wait also serve” (stressed syllables bolded). But as we can see, this line would not have satisfied the rules of iambic pentameter. Instead, Milton writes:\\n“They also serve who only stand and wait.”\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can freely leave out English articles (a, an, the) to save syllables or to maintain iambic pentameter. For example, instead of writing “through the bright window (stressed syllables bolded), you might write ”through window bright.” Going back to line thirteen, you can see that Milton does not use the article “the” to refer to either “land” or “ocean”:\\n“And post o’er land and ocean without rest;\"'],\n",

For example, someone “feeling blue” is someone feeling sad, not literally blue. Consider these examples of literary devices used in “On His Blindness”:\\n\\n\\nMetaphor: A metaphor is a literary device that identifies one thing as being the same as another, even when the two “things” being compared are unrelated. In line one of “On His Blindness,” Milton uses metaphor when he identifies his lost vision as “light” that is now “spent.”\\n\\n\\nPersonification: Personification involves attaching human characteristics with anything from natural phenomena to inanimate objects. For example, the phrase “the raging hurricane” personifies the hurricane by giving it the human emotion of rage. In line eight of “On His Blindness,” Milton personifies patience, giving it a capitalized name and a voice.\\n\\n\\nAlliteration: Alliteration is a stylistic literary device involving grouping together words starting with the same letter or a similar sound. The tongue-twister ”She Sells Seashells By the Seashore” features multiple examples of alliteration.

The sestet can follow multiple rhyme schemes (more below). Rhyming lines are grouped by the same letter. For example, the last word of the first “A” line must rhyme with the last words of all other “A” lines.\\nConsider these rhymes in the famous Italian sonnet “On His Blindness” by John Milton:\\n(A) When I consider how my light is spent(B) Ere half my days in this dark world and wide,(B) And that one talent which is death to hide,(A) Lodg\\'d with me useless, though my soul more bent(A) To serve therewith my Maker, and present(B) My true account, lest he returning chide,(B) \"Doth God exact day-labour, light denied?\"(A) I fondly ask.

       "                         {'\\nChoose a genre.': ['Choosing a Story Type and Genre The selection of genre will influence the type of story you tell and the amount of attention you give to characters, prose, and setting, respectively.Literary fiction. Authors of literary fiction are seeking first and foremost to create a work of art. Multi-dimensional characters and the quality of prose are of primary importance, with plot sometimes a secondary consideration. Richard Russo’s Empire Falls or The Gold Finch by Donna Tartt are excellent examples of literary fiction with sparkling prose and complex characters.\\nGenre fiction. While genre fiction can achieve the status of art, books in these genres are generally seen as more commercial. It is divided into many categories to help readers find the sort of books they like to read.\\n\\n\\nMysteries – Books about a crime, usually a murder. While a well-plotted mystery is important, it is often the characters that really make a mystery memorable. Think Sherlock Holmes, Miss Marple, or Mma Precious Ramotswe from The No. 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency.\\n\\nThrillers – Books designed to make the reader’s pulse race and to keep him or her turning pages. Lee Child’s Jack Reacher books are a good example. Like mysteries, they are plot and character driven. They often feature a race against time, as in Dan Brown’s The Da Vinci Code.\\n\\nRomance – Books about love and romance, usually following two characters and the obstacles that keep them apart. The most successful romance writers, like Nicholas Sparks and Nora Roberts, combine interesting characters with richly detailed settings that draw the reader in.\\n\\nFantasy – Books about imaginary worlds, usually involving magic. Setting is of primary importance. The goal, as in J.R.R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings or George R.R. Martin’s Song of Ice and Fire series, is to create a richly detailed world that readers want to return to again and again.\\n\\nScience Fiction – Books that imagine alternate realities or worlds based on science as opposed to magic. As with fantasy, setting is key. Books like Frank Herbert’s Dune or Isaac Asimov’s Foundation create richly imagined worlds, complete with their own climate, politics, religion, food, and technology.\\n\\nHistorical – Books that are set in the past, combining elements of fiction with accurate details of the time period. They tend to emphasize plot and setting. The best historical fiction – like Robert Graves’ I, Claudius or Hilary Mantel’s Wolf Hall – recreates the past so convincingly, the reader forgets they are reading fiction.\\n\\nHorror – Books that create a feeling of terror or dread in the reader, often incorporating supernatural elements. These books emphasize plot and tone. Stephen King’s books are the gold standard.\\n\\nYoung Adult – Books that are for and about teenagers and pre-teens (12-18 years old). They are usually combined with another genre, often romance or fantasy. This field has grown rapidly of late, with series like Harry Potter and The Hunger Games transcending the genre to become bestsellers.'],\n",

Take her Cardinal Wolsey from Wolf Hall: “The cardinal, at fifty-five, is still as handsome as he was in his prime. Tonight, he is dressed not in his everyday scarlet, but in blackish purple and fine white lace: like a humble bishop. His height impresses; his belly, which in justice should belong to a more sedentary man, is merely another princely aspect of his being, and on it, confidingly, he often rests a large, white, beringed hand. A large head—surely designed by God to support the papal tiara—is carried superbly on broad shoulders: shoulders upon which rest (though not at this moment) the great chain of Lord Chancellor of England.”\\nPick a name. You can pick any name you want, but if you are writing historical fiction, you may want to check the Medieval Names Archive (which also covers pre-medieval names) to make sure your names are historically accurate.\\nFlesh out your characters.

Flat, with an unrelieved and monotonous flatness, enough of itself, some might say, to drive a man to unquiet and sleep-defeating thoughts.

Now is the time to make certain that voice is consistent.\\nDraft 4 – Polish your prose. There is no sense dong this in the early drafts, because you will end up cutting much of what you write. So save the polishing until you are satisfied with your plot and characters. And don’t forget these four key editing tips:Make sure your descriptions are vibrant (“she had emerald eyes and smooth, golden skin the color of the desert sands,” not “she was beautiful”).\\nShow, don’t tell (“his jaw clinched,” not “he was angry).\\nBe wary of adverbs; they are rarely necessary (“she sauntered” instead of “she walked slowly).\\nAvoid clichés.'],\n",

The best way to develop an idea is to start somewhere – a place, character, even a great title – and start writing. What makes and idea good is putting in the time necessary to develop the characters, plot, and setting.J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone is a good example of a wonderful idea that was built over time, rather than conceived all at once. The basic idea – an eleven year old boy is invited to attend a magical school for wizards, where he must confront the evil that killed his parents – is fine, but there is nothing great about it. What makes the book work is the details that grew from that idea: Hogwarts with its talking pictures and moving staircases; owls delivering mail; Quidditch; Bertie Bott’s every flavor beans… One could go on and on.'],\n",

You may decide to write your own teen romance novel, especially if you are a fan of the genre. Writing an original teen romance may seem like a daunting task, as there are so many storylines in teen romance that have already been done. You can focus on creating an original romance novel for teens by creating a unique story idea and unique characters. You should then make sure your story is well-written and polish it until it feels original and compelling.)': defaultdict(list,\n",

Cliches are phrases or descriptions that have become so familiar they have lost all meaning. The romance genre tends to be littered with cliches so you should do your best to have descriptions that feel specific and unique to your story, rather than phrases a reader may have heard before.For example, you should avoid describing a character as “really good looking”, “sultry and sexy”, or “tall, dark, and handsome.” These descriptions have been used before many times and will not have much of an impact on readers.\\nInstead, you should create descriptions that feel specific to your story’s narrative voice and your main character. Your main character may describe an attractive guy as “better looking than my childhood crush, Tristan” or a mean girl as “worse than my mother on a good day.” Keep your descriptions fresh and unique to your characters so they do not become cliche.'],\n",

You may put an original spin on a story you have read before or a common storyline in teen romance novels. Remember your audience is teens so your story idea should contain elements that teens are interested in, such as young love, intense emotion, sexual awakening, and an aversion to authority.For example, you may put a spin on the girl meets boy or boy meets girl storyline by having the boy/girl be an alien from another planet or have the girl/boy possess a superpower that tends to repel most boys/girls.\\nYou may also draw on your own life experiences to help you create an interesting story idea for your romance novel. Think about how you felt as a teenager and some of the situations or conflicts you got yourself into. You could then use your experiences to create a storyline for your novel.;'],\n",

Having a perfect, safe main character will likely lead to a boring teen romance novel that may not find many readers.For example, you may have a main character who realizes s/he can read minds, but struggles to make friends at his/her high school or get the attention of a girl/boy s/he likes.

Make sure you include all the awkward moments of a first kiss, a first make out, and a first time. This will make the scenes feel more honest and believable to teens.\\nThough you may want to include notes about safe sex, such as the use of condoms, you should not paint sex as a taboo, shameful thing.

This is a deliberate choice on the part of the songs\\' creators. A song\\'s production values are a serious factor to consider before releasing it to the public - minor flaws like missed notes, background noise, and noticeable transitions between separate takes can become glaringly obvious with repeated listens. Though there\\'s certainly a market for music with a lo-fi aesthetic, the market for sleek, polished recordings is undeniably bigger. So, at the very least, be sure to consider whether your music\\'s production values suit your professional goals.\\n\\n\\nSome musicians have the experience and know-how to produce their own music - Kanye West and some of his peers in the world of hip-hop, for instance, produce many of their own songs. However, many musicians don\\'t know how to \"work the boards\", so to speak. If you fall into this group, consider paying for studio time with a professional producer, who will be able to help you record and mix your music as professionally as possible.'],\n",

To start building an audience and gaining recognition as a musician, it\\'s important to put in work as a live act. To start, look for opportunities to perform in your local area. Bars, clubs, and cafes are the \"classic\" proving grounds for up-and-coming musicians, but they\\'re far from the only places where you can perform. Any place or occasion where people gather can conceivably be an opportunity to perform. Weddings, birthday parties, farmer\\'s markets, and even street corners can be places to build your audience and sell your music.\\n\\n\\nDon\\'t be afraid to start small - all but the luckiest musicians paid their dues as local acts before making it big.

Also be sure to take advantage of your online visibility. Nowadays, a well-timed social media \"push\" can be a much more effective and efficient way to reach your fan base than conventional advertising.\\n\\n\\nThe humble flyer is a well-worn method by which musicians self-promote. These can be easily massed-produced for relatively cheap with nothing more than a basic computer and a printer.

Though large, international record companies occasionally sign artists that are relatively unknown in terms of mainstream airplay (see: Epic Records signing experimental hip hop group Death Grips), obscure and up-and-coming artists may have more luck when courting smaller independent labels. Research labels that release the type of music you're interested in selling. Then, if they have a policy of accepting unsolicited submissions, feel free to send them demos, photos, interviews, reviews, biographies, and the like (if sent all together, these types of materials compose what is called a press pack, a standard method artists use to distribute their work and propagate their image).\\n\\n\\nOf course, perhaps the best way to get noticed by a record company is to generate attention for yourself through groundbreaking music innovation, noteworthy live performances, and/or a unique image. In other words, if you're able to generate fame (or notoriety) without a record label, record labels may come to you.\"],\n",

Generally, in the studio, artists partner with a producer or engineer to create a finished product that\\'s to their satisfaction. Recording your music gives you the opportunity to distribute it to your fans (in physical form as a CD or online as a file) in a polished, definitive form that\\'s exactly how you want it. It also gives you the opportunity to give your music to the types of people who can help you make money from your music - namely, record companies and industry scouts. If you haven\\'t recorded any music yet, you may want to record a demo as your first move. Demos are short (about 3-6 tracks) \"mini-albums\" that give you a chance to showcase your musical style - think of them as musical resumes for prospective employers.\\n\\n\\n\\nMeticulously practice your songs before you step into the studio. Studio time can be quite expensive, so you\\'ll want to be able to record each song in as few takes as possible. The costs associated with lengthy studio sessions can quickly add up, so try to get to the point where you can play all of your songs in your sleep before you attempt to record them.\\nFor the same reason as you\\'ll want to have your songs down pat before you enter the studio, you\\'ll also want to avoid excessive experimentation in the studio. For instance, don\\'t let a producer convince you to waste time trying out countless effects pedals. The place for experimentation and improvisation is in the practice room.'],\n",

Now that you have your song\\'s lyrics and instrumental parts figured out, it\\'s time to set your words to music. Give your lyrics a melody, or, perhaps more accurately, melodies - most songs have related, but distinct melodies for verses, choruses, etc. Though some musicians use the concept of discord (conflict between the notes or chords in a piece of music) to great effect, generally, you\\'ll want your vocal melody to be in an appropriate key for the chords of your song.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s certainly not impossible to become successful writing and selling a cappella songs (songs with only vocals and no instruments) or purely instrumental recordings. For instance, Shai\\'s version of \"If I Ever Fall in Love\" is an a cappella song that spent time at #2 on the US charts. Similarly, the recent explosion in popularity of electronic dance music has made hits out of songs with few (if any) lyrics. However, the vast majority of popular music has both instrumentals and lyrics, so writing these types of songs may give you more mass appeal.\\nNote that, if you\\'re writing rap songs, you generally won\\'t have to worry about vocal melodies, as \"pure\" rap vocals are delivered tonelessly. However, many hip-hop artists incorporate tonality into their songs in the form of sung refrains or half-sung, half-rapped verses.

Some songs are laid-back and relaxed, others are tense and paranoid. Some carry great personal significance for the writer, while others are about nothing at all. However, nearly all great songs convey some sort of emotion. For starters, when you write songs, try to express the way you feel when you think about certain topics, events, or people that are important to you. Your lyrics don\\'t necessarily have to mention these things directly, though they certainly can.\\n\\n\\nLet\\'s examine the opening lines of two songs - first, Elliott Smith\\'s \"Between the Bars\" and, second, Kendrick Lamar\\'s \"Swimming Pools (Drank)\".

But, at the halfway point of the movie, something happens to make it impossible to turn back. A Bond villain attacks again, the Gladiator arrives in Rome, Thelma and Louise rob their first store, etc.\\n\\nThe Major Set-Back: Since the point of no return the stakes have gotten higher.

There's no right or wrong!\\n\\n\\nAnd when it comes to footwear, aim for an exercise shoe that's worn in. If it has too much tread, you won't be able to float and pivot like you want. For the record, it's worth investing in some dance sneakers if you do decide to stick to it. They're only about $30.00 from a discount dance supply store and can easily be found online.\"],\n",

It has high-energy rhythms and distinctive Latin beats that will guarantee you\\'re sweating and having a great time.\\n\\nZumba Toning: With this class, you use toning sticks. Think of them as fitness maracas for your abs, glutes, arms, and thighs.\\n\\nZumba Gold: This class is aimed at baby boomers and above. The class is a bit calmer than the standard, though it follows the same basic principles.\\n\\nZumba Gold Toning: No surprises here, it\\'s Zumba Toning for the wise-beyond-their-years population. A large group, for the record!\\n\\nAqua Zumba: Effectively marketed as a \"Zumba pool party.\" You do the same (and more) Zumba moves, only halfway emerged in water. You can imagine how much tougher it is!\\n\\nZumba Sentao: This class is centered around a chair. It helps strengthen your core, work on balance, and steps up the cardio in a new and dynamic way.\\n\"Zumba Step\": All of the Step toning and strengthening for legs and glutes plus all of the Zumba® fitness-party fun.\\n\\nZumba in the Circuit: This combines Zumba and circuit training. Between dancing your butt off, you\\'ll be doing strength exercises to get an all-around workout.\\n\\nZumba Kids: For the little ones!'],\n",
